# Grant's ocvm fork
OpenComputer Emulator

This emulator is inspired by the outstanding work done by gamax with OCEmu ( https://github.com/gamax92/OCEmu ).

This project will not be nearly as impressive as OCEmu, nonetheless I embark.

**Project Goals**

1. Learn lua binding and environment emulation from a C++ application.
2. Provide memory and cpu profiling for debugging operating systems for OpenComputers
3. A purely command line emulator (e.g. over-ssh support)

**Expected Disadvantages**

1. The terminal graphics layer depends on ansi escape codes, not quite cross platform
2. I am building the C++ binding and (de)serialization for all lua callback and arguments by hand (error-prone)
3. Displayed font will be host machine fonts using utf8 encoding, I will not be rendering OC fonts
4. pty applications do not get all key events, such as no key releases. I can emulate key releases some of the time, but not all of the time.

But this should be a lot of fun!

**How to Build**

Just run `make` in the source root. If successful, you should have a `ocvm` binary. Run it using `./ocvm`

There are some requirements for building:
1. svn: The Makefile will download OpenComputers source files
    If you do have svn available, or prefer to prepare the system/ dir by hand, from the source root:
    1. mkdir system
    2. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/lua/machine.lua -O system/machine.lua`
    3. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/lua/bios.lua -O system/bios.lua`
    4. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/font.hex -O system/font.hex`

2. g++ 5.4 with c++14 support (experimental/filesystem is used)
3. lua5.2 (`make lua=5.3` to use lua5.3)
4. A vt100 compatible terminal

**Future Scope**

I plan to add support for building ocvm on Mac using boost filesystem and clang+llvm

I (Grant) am using this fork to make ocvm work on Windows with minimal changes
